/**
 * this is a definition of API to source of audio data
 *
 * THE SOURCE is any component in the system that have data stored somehow and can give the
 * data outside at request. The source API does not define who and how has produced the data
 *
 * The user - a module - sees this as a producer that PROVIDES data for processing
 * The IMPLEMENTATION - audio_stream, DP Queue - sees this API as a destination it must send data to
 * *
 * Examples of components that should expose source API:
 *  - DMIC
 *	Data are coming from the outside world, stores in tmp buffer and can be presented
 *	to the rest of the system using source_api
 *  - a memory ring buffer
 *	Data are coming from other module (usually using sink_api, but it does not matter in fact)
 *
 *  The main advantage of using source API instead of just taking pointers to the data is that
 *  the data may be prepared at the moment the data receiver is requesting it. i.e.
 *   - cache may be written back/invalidated if necessary
 *   - data may be moved from circular to linear space
 *   - part of the buffer may be locked to prevent writing
 *   etc.etc. it depends on implementation of the data source
 *
 * Data in general are provided as a circular buffer and the data receiver should be able to
 * deal with it. Of course if needed an implementation of source providing linear data can be
 * implemented and used as a mid-layer for modules needing it.
 *
 * NOTE: the module should get a complete portion of data it needs for processing, process it
 *       than release. The reason is - the depending on the implementation, the calls may be
 *       expensive - may involve some data moving in memory, cache writebacks, etc.
