# Smart Amp External Library Release

To build FW binary including Smart Amp applying the third-party solution, the
pre-compiled library should be placed under this directory in local environment.

The library itself should be statically linked with the SoF FW binary image, as
the configuration has been stated in src/audio/smart_amp/CMakeLists.txt
