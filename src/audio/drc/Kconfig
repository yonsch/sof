	  Select for Dynamic Range Compressor (DRC) component. A DRC can be used
	  to reduce the volume of loud sounds and amplify silent sounds thus
	  compressing an audio signal's dynamic range.

	help
	  Determines the length of pre-delay frame buffers which are allocated
	  runtime on DRC setup. It requires to be a 2^N number. 512 is
	  suggested by inference to avoid memory waste and provide reasonable
	  length for pre-delay frames.
